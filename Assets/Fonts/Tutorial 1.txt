Welcome to Pipeline Bakery!
Our job is to feed the very hungry processor.
He likes instructions.
To make the processor happy, we have to feed him instruction sets without hazards.
Let's start simple.

This is an arithmetic instruction.
It has five parts:
MEM, the initial memory read.
REG, where the processor selects what register to operate on.
ALU, where the processor's arithmetic logic unit performs mathematical operations.
MEM, where the memory is written to after operations.
REG,  where the processor writes the result to a register after operations.
